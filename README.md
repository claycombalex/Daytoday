# Thank you for using Daytoday!

This Java app is intended as a more complex time management tool. It includes a calendar, to-do list, and countdowns. However, the most important (and complex) feature is the automatically generated daily schedules. The more time you spend creating events and customizing, the more useful this app will be to you. Of course you do not have to follow the schedules exactly, but it provides a useful example of how you could allocate your time. It is ideal for someone who has a lot of various things to do, but has no idea where to start.



## NEW USER
When you initially start up the software, it will ask you for some information.

Name: The name of the user. This app supports multiple users on the same computer.
Theme: Choose between dark or light theme.

Set as default: Because this app supports multiple users, if there are more than one users the app needs to decide what to do. If this user is set as default, the app will start on the home screen for this user. If no user is set as default, a user select screen will be shown instead.

Desired hours of sleep: Dedicated sleeping time is added onto the generated schedules. This setting will determine how many hours of sleep to put on the schedule.

Desired bedtime: What time do you want to go to sleep on the schedule.

Bedtime Importance: This is used when an event interferes with sleep on the generated schedule. If you decide a full nights rest isn't super important, then its possible that important events will take away a few hours of your sleep.



## EVENTS
Events are the core of this app. The calendar, schedule, todo list, and countdowns are just visual representations of the events you create. Therefore, to get maximum effectiveness out of this app, create events correctly.

There are two major classes of events: Recurring Events and One-Time Events.

### RECURRING EVENTS
Recurring Events repeat at a set interval. This could be daily, weekly, biweekly, yearly, or whatever. An example of a Recurring event would be a college club meeting. Club meetings usually happen once a week for an entire semester. Another example of a Recurring event would be a job. Most jobs have a schedule of Monday to Friday, repeating every week. Go to (RECURRING EVENTS) for more info regarding custom intervals.

### ONE-TIME EVENTS
One-Time Events are tasks that you only have to complete once and then the event is over. An example of a One-Time Event would be a specific exam. You only have to take the exam once and then you are done with it forever. Go to (ONE-TIME EVENTS) for more info.

### CREATING AN EVENT
Name of event: Specify what this event is. Try to be specific (i.e. write "Public Speaking Class" instead of "Class").
Is this event recurring: See the above paragraphs. Is this event a One-Time Event or a Recurring Event?
Does this event have a set end time and start time: (blank)
